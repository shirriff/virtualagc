The core rope for program SUNDANCE 302 should 6 modules (B1-B6) in total.  At present, we have the contents of just 3 modules (B2-B4).  For archival purpose those are stored in the file Sundance302-B2thruB4.bin in yaAGC format but with the areas corresponding to the missing modules omitted.  

This data was obtained from dumps of physical fixed-memory modules in the personal collections of the following original AGC developers, using the restored AGC owned by collector Jimmie Loocke in July 2019:

* B2 (p/n 2003972-451), Don Eyles
* B3 (p/n 2003972-461), Don Eyles
* B4 (p/n 2003972-471), Eldon Hall

_Hopefully_ other AGC developers similarly have the missing modules as souvenirs, and thus it may be possible over time to dump their contents as well, and thus obtain the entire program.

Source code will become available as it becomes available via regeneration from related programs and disassembly.
