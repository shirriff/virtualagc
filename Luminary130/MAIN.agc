### FILE="Main.annotation"
# Copyright:	Public domain.
# Filename:	MAIN.agc
# Purpose:	The main source file for the reconstructed Luminary 130.
#		This was the original program released for the Apollo 13 LM,
#		although several more revisions would follow. It has been
#		reconstructed from a listing of Luminary 131, from which it
#		differs on only two lines in P70-P71. The difference is
#		described in detail in Luminary memo #129, which was used
#		to perform the reconstruction. This file is intended to be a
#		faithful reconstruction, except that the code format has been
#		changed to conform to the requirements of the yaYUL assembler
#		rather than the original YUL assembler.
# Assembler:	yaYUL

# Mod history:	04/12/03 RSB.	Began.
#		05/05/03 RSB.	...continued.
#		05/11/03 RSB	Draft of this file completed.
#		06/08/03 RSB	Drafts of all the included files completed.
#		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website reference above.
#		06/30/09 RSB	Added an experimental HTML note.
#		2017-01-06 RSB	Changed page-number references so that they
#				refer to the markings on the physical pages
#				of the printout (rather than PDF "pages" in
#				the file 1729.pdf, which is no longer the
#				associated reference material).
#		2017-01-20 RSB	Changed GOTOP00H to GOTOPOOH in all *.agc
#				files.  There are probably more POO problems
#				but those are the only ones I fixed.
#		2017-02-12 RSB	References to the scanned assembly listing
#				have been updated now that a more-legible
#				scan is available than before.
#		2018-09-04 MAS	Copied from Luminary 131 for Luminary 130.
#
# The contents of these "Luminary130" files were originally (2003)
# transcribed from a scanned document obtained from MIT's
# now-defunct history or recent technology website, but which can be
# consulted now at
#	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Luminary131
# As of 2017, however, there is a far-more legible scan, created from the same
# physical printout, which you should instead consult, at either
# 	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/Luminary131-Eyles
# or
#	https://archive.org/details/luminary131agcpr00miti
# Notations within the original program listing read, in part:
#
#	NASA Apollo LUMINARY 131 (1C) Program Source Code Listing.
#	MIT Instrumentation/Draper Laboratory -- 19 December 1969, 1742 pages.
#	This listing contains the flight program for the Lunar Module 
#	as created by MIT's Draper Lab for the Apollo 13/14 moon missions.
#
# Modifications were then made to P70-P71 to match how it would have been in
# Luminary 130, according to Luminary memo #129.
#
# This file is a little different from the other Luminary130 files I'm providing, 
# in that it doesn't represent anything that appears directly in the original source.  
# What I (RSB) have done for organizational purposes is to split the huge monolithic
# source code into smaller, more manageable chunks--i.e., into individual source 
# files.  Those files are rejoined within this file as "includes".  It just makes
# it a little easier to work with.  The code chunks correspond to natural divisions
# into sub-programs.  In fact, these divisions are more-or-less specified by
# the source code itself.  Refer to the "TABLE OF SUBROUTINE LOG SECTIONS" at the
# very beginning of the file ASSEMBLY_AND_OPERATION_INFORMATION.agc.
#
# It may be reasonably asked why tens of thousands of lines of source are joined by
# means of inclusion, rather than simply assembling the source files individually and
# then linking them to form the executable.  The answer is that the original 
# development team had no linker.  The builds were monolithic just like this.
# There was a big emphasis on reusability of the code in the original project, 
# apparently, but this reusability took the form of inserting your deck of 
# punch-cards at the appropriate position in somebody else's deck of punch-cards.
# So, indeed, the method of file-inclusion is a very fair representation of the 
# methods used in the original development ... with the improvement, of course,
# that you no longer have to worry about dropping the card deck.  On the other hand, 
# I wasn't there at the time, so I may have no idea what I'm talking about.
#
# Finally, note that the original Apollo AGC assembler (called "YUL") is no longer 
# available (as far as I can tell).  The replacement assembler yaYUL accepts 
# a slightly different format for the source code from what YUL accepted, so the 
# source code has been targeted for assembly with yaYUL.

# What follows is simply a bunch of file-includes for the individual code chunks.
# I've marked the page numbers vs. the original scanned listing (1729.pdf) to 
# make proof-reading easier.  Besides, the scanned listing contains a lot of
# interesting tables (cross-referenced to page numbers) created by YUL, 
# but not duplicated by yaYUL, so it's still valuable even if the source-files
# listed below are in hand.  Notice, though, that the page number herein are those
# the scanned (PDF) file, and not those which are marked on the scanned pages
# themselves, so there is not an exact correspondence between YUL-generated
# page numbers appearing within tables and the page numbers marked in this source
# code.
