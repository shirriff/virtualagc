### FILE="Main.annotation"
## Copyright:	Public domain.
## Filename:	ALARM_AND_ABORT.agc
## Purpose:	A section of the reconstructed source code for Luminary 130.
##		This was the original program released for the Apollo 13 LM,
##		although several more revisions would follow. It has been
##		reconstructed from a listing of Luminary 131, from which it
##		differs on only two lines in P70-P71. The difference is
##		described in detail in Luminary memo #129, which was used
##		to perform the reconstruction. This file is intended to be a
##		faithful reconstruction, except that the code format has been
##		changed to conform to the requirements of the yaYUL assembler
##		rather than the original YUL assembler.
